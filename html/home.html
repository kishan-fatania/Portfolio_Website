    <h1> Hi my name is Kishan, welcome to my web portfolio!</h1>
</div>

<p id="intro">As a graduate from the University of Nottingham with a degree in Neuroscience, why am I training as an IT
    consultant
    I hear you say?<br/><br/>

    Well my degree allowed me to experiment with programming and from the moment I wrote my first working script, I
    haven't looked back!<br/><br/>

    Which brings us here, to my web portfolio, where I hope to share with you some of the cool projects I've been busy
    working on recently.<br/><br/>
